# experiment00

Toy project for exploring Rust. Really, I'm trying to see how easy it is to recreate ServiceNow's Table API in Rust using the PostgreSQL database, as I've found that feature to be useful enough to use in future web projects.

## To dos

1. Recreate the Table API.
1. Add security, customizability, optimizations, etc.
1. ???
1. Profit!
